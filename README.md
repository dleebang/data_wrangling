# data_wrangling

Data wrangling R scripts written for practice and assessments of HarvardX's Data Wrangling course in the Data Science Professional Certificate Program (https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-wrangling). The scripts are focused to manipulate, (re)shape and clean data for further analysis. 

Those skills for data manipulation are combined with web scraping techniques to make a sentiment analysis from twitter texts.
